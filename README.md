#About
WasteRemoval will reside in your menubar (almost No UI) and empty your trash whenever you get below 250MB free disk space. [or a choosable no of bytes]

##License
Tool is technically designed to be released to the app store. It's something I threw together real quick because I needed the functionality. 
Pragmatically viewed this was a waste of time :D
#The tool may serve as a 'teaching example' and I therefore release it under BSD
